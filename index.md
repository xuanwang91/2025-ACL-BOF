# ACL 2025 BoF: Bridging Human Study and LLM Agents for Social Simulation

{% include figure.html img="ACL25_BOF.pdf" alt="intro image here" width="100%" align="left" %}

Date: **Tuesday, July 29, 2025**

Time: **16:00 - 17:30 PM in Vienna Time (10:00 – 11:30 AM ET / 9:00 – 10:30 AM CT / 7:00 – 8:30 AM PT in US Time)**

Location: **[Online via Underline](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/81864504603?pwd=cjvK4uCYYMd1AvKcpaqNI0LFRq5bDL.1)**

## Event Description
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for simulating complex human behaviors and interactions at scale. These capabilities offer exciting potential for conducting large-scale social simulations, enabling researchers to explore hypotheses in social science, psychology, political science, and more. However, critical gaps remain between traditional empirical human studies and LLM-driven agent simulations. This BoF aims to bring together researchers across NLP, social sciences, HCI, and AI ethics to discuss key questions: How can we ensure that LLM agents faithfully represent human behaviors? What are the methodological, ethical, and technical challenges in integrating human data and LLM simulations? How can social simulations with LLMs complement or extend human subject research?

## Pre-Event Survey
This 90-minute participant-driven session aims to foster meaningful discussion and collaboration across NLP, cognitive science, and computational social science communities. In addition to open discussion (welcoming everyone!), we are also looking for participants who might be interested in:

1. Giving a **short lightning talk** during the BoF
2. Collaborating on a **potential position paper** after event
3. Helping organize a **follow-up workshop** (e.g., ACL 2026)

To help us prepare and coordinate, especially if you are interested in any of the above activities, please fill out this short survey: [**Pre-Event Survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMj6X4RXfGgJPRjXpRDo1EEmE1TgEtGZ2V9yEArkJ_RvfyLA/viewform?usp=header). The survey deadline is **Sunday, July 27, 2025**.
